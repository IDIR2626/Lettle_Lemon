# Little Lemon App

## Overview

The Little Lemon App is a simple restaurant app developed as part of the Android Development course on Coursera by Meta. The primary goal of this app is to serve as a practical learning project to implement fundamental Android development concepts, specifically focusing on building a user interface using Jetpack Compose.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout the course and the development of this app, I have gained proficiency in the following key areas:

- **Jetpack Compose:** Utilized Jetpack Compose to build a modern and dynamic user interface for the restaurant app.

- **Composable Functions:** Leveraged the power of Compose's composable functions to create reusable and modular UI components.

- **State Management:** Implemented state management within composable functions to handle dynamic UI updates and user interactions.

- **Navigation in Compose:** Utilized the Navigation component in Jetpack Compose to handle navigation between different screens in the app.

- **Animation:** Incorporated animations to enhance the user experience and add visual appeal to various elements within the app.
